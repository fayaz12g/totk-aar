# Any Aspect Ratio for Tears of the Kingdom!
Any Aspect Ratio for Tears of the Kingdom! With HUD fix and controller merge and blackscreenfix

download link: https://github.com/fayaz12g/totk-aar/releases/download/3.0.0/AAR.3.1.0.zip

This utility lets you select the following:

Aspect Ratio (type in ANY two numbers, like the resolution of your display)

Controller Type, Button Color, and Button Layout

Centered or Corner HUD

It will then create a mod given all those parameters, including a HUD fix, a fix for link in the menu, and the aspect ratio mod itself, and black screen fix. If you use this utility, disable BlackscreenFIX, Controller Mods, and my Any Aspect Ratio mod. This one file will do all that for you and more!

You need Python 3.11 to use this. If you don't have it, open PowerShell and enter "python". Then download what it opens.

Known Issues
- Elden Ring only uses Colored button. Selecting White buttons uses colored buttons
- v3.1 freezes on modyfying BLYT folder. Use v3 instead. (edit, i have deleted 3.1 as im away from home this weekend. I will re-add the console GUI later.
- Character names are stretched
- aspect ratios below 16:9 dont support corner HUD
- The Elden Ring layout yields Colored regardless of white being entered
- item pickup text is stretched
- all HUD elements aren't cornered (item pickup, location name)


Stretch Goals
- Colored Dualsense Controller Options
- DualShock Controller Option
- Stadia Controller Option
- Steam Controller
- Steam Deck picture
- python 3.11 is required but if I call the functions using subprocesses i could avoid this 
- include a feature to specify a FOV
- include a "launch game" button
- include checkbox for yuzu or ryujinx to output straight to mods folder (wont work if your yuzu/ryu directory is not in the default location)

I was asked if I had a ko-fi so I made one. Don't feel like you need to donate, I made the utility just to help the community: https://ko-fi.com/fayaz12
