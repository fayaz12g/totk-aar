This utility lets you select the following:

Aspect Ratio (type in ANY two numbers, like the resolution of your display)

Controller Type, Button Color, and Button Layout and Controller Color using StaavasEVG's Dualsense Mod

Apply all the GBAtemp fixes automatically into a readable dynamic pchtxt

Create custom INI files for dFPS

Centered or Corner HUD


It will then create a mod given all those parameters, including a HUD fix, a fix for link in the menu, and the aspect ratio mod itself, and black screen fix. If you use this utility, disable BlackscreenFIX, Controller Mods, and my Any Aspect Ratio mod. This one file will do all that for you and more!
